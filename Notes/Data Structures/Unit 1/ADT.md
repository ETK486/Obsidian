###### Definition:
	Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations that are independent of any particular implementation.
###### Explanation:
	The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view.

###### Features of ADT:
	Abstract data types (ADTs) are a way of encapsulating data and operations on that data into a single unit. Some of the key features of ADTs include:

- **Abstraction:** The user does not need to know the implementation of the data structure only essentials are provided.
- **Better Conceptualization:** ADT gives us a better conceptualization of the real world.
- **Robust:** The program is robust and has the ability to catch errors.
- **Encapsulation**: ADTs hide the internal details of the data and provide a public interface for users to interact with the data. This allows for easier maintenance and modification of the data structure.
- **Data Abstraction**: ADTs provide a level of abstraction from the implementation details of the data. Users only need to know the operations that can be performed on the data, not how those operations are implemented.
- **Data Structure Independence**: ADTs can be implemented using different data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, without affecting the functionality of the ADT.
- **Information Hiding:** ADTs can protect the integrity of the data by allowing access only to authorized users and operations. This helps prevent errors and misuse of the data.
- **Modularity:** ADTs can be combined with other ADTs to form larger, more complex data structures. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in programming.
###### Advantages:
- **Encapsulation**: ADTs provide a way to encapsulate data and operations into a single unit, making it easier to manage and modify the data structure.
- **Abstraction**: ADTs allow users to work with data structures without having to know the implementation details, which can simplify programming and reduce errors.
- **Data Structure Independence**: ADTs can be implemented using different data structures, which can make it easier to adapt to changing needs and requirements.
- **Information Hiding**: ADTs can protect the integrity of data by controlling access and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Modularity**: ADTs can be combined with other ADTs to form more complex data structures, which can increase flexibility and modularity in programming.
###### Disadvantages:
- **Overhead**: Implementing ADTs can add overhead in terms of memory and processing, which can affect performance.
- **Complexity**: ADTs can be complex to implement, especially for large and complex data structures.
- **Learning** Curve: Using ADTs requires knowledge of their implementation and usage, which can take time and effort to learn.
- **Limited Flexibility:** Some ADTs may be limited in their functionality or may not be suitable for all types of data structures.
- **Cost**: Implementing ADTs may require additional resources and investment, which can increase the cost of development.
