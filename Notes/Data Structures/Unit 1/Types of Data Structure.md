###### Types of Data Structure:
	- Linear Data Structure
	- Non Linear Data Structure
###### Linear Data Structure:
	Linear data structures can be  constructed as a continuous arrangement of data  elements in the memory. It can be constructed by  using array data type. In the linear Data Structures the  relationship of adjacency is maintained between the  data elements.
###### Non Linear Data Structure:
	Non-linear data Structure can be constructed as a collection of randomly distributed set of data item joined together  by using a special pointer (tag). In non-linear Data  structure the relationship of adjacency is not  maintained between the data items.
#### Linear Data Structures:
###### [[Array]] :
	An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element in it.

###### [[Linked List]]:
	A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

###### [[Stack]]:
	Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

###### [[Queue]]:
	A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.

#### Non Linear Data Structures:

[[Tree]]:

	A tree data structure consists of various nodes linked together. The structure of a tree is hierarchical that forms a relationship like that of the parent and a child. The structure of the tree is formed in a way that there is one connection for every parent-child node relationship. Only one path should exist between the root to a node in the tree. Various types of trees are present based on their structures like AVL tree, binary tree, binary search tree, etc.
 Graph:
 
	Graphs are those types of non-linear data structures which consist of a definite quantity of vertices and edges. The vertices or the nodes are involved in storing data and the edges show the vertices relationship. The difference between a graph to a tree is that in a graph there are no specific rules for the connection of nodes. Real-life problems like social networks, telephone networks, etc. can be represented through the graphs.
